AI Adoption Framework for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) with Prototype Implementation

- Project Description
This project studies the challenges faced by Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in adopting Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies. Based on literature review and analysis, a gradual AI adoption framework is proposed.
To validate the feasibility of the framework, a prototype AI-based customer support chatbot was implemented using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

- Problem Statement
Small industries often fail to adopt AI due to high cost, lack of technical expertise, absence of structured data and fear of technological complexity.

- Proposed Solution
A gradual adoption model consisting of four stages:
Awareness and training
Digitization and data collection
Integration using simple AI tools
Optimization and automation

-Prototype Implementation
A chatbot prototype was developed using Dialogflow NLP platform to demonstrate low-cost AI adoption.

The chatbot:
Understands customer queries
Responds automatically
Provides business information
Demonstrates practical AI usage for SMEs

- Technologies Used:
Artificial Intelligence (Conceptual)
Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Google Dialogflow
Cloud-based AI services

- Learning Outcome:
The project demonstrates that SMEs can begin AI adoption using simple and affordable AI tools without building complex AI systems.

- Future Scope:
AI readiness assessment system
Demand prediction module
Inventory management assistant

 -Tools Used:
  Research Papers (Google Scholar)
  PowerPoint / Google Slides
  GitHub

- Conclusion:
Although AI offers many benefits, SMEs face multiple barriers in adoption. With proper training, affordable solutions and policy support, SMEs can successfully integrate AI and improve operational efficiency and innovation.
